* HD Protocol

This is the successor to MIDI developed behind closed doors by the HD
Working Group (HDWG) at the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA.)

Started in 2005. Demonstrated to some manufacturers on January 27, 2013.

  members of the HDWG)

** Information accessible from publicly accessible information

name: HD Protocol
creators: MMA HDWG members
known hardware implementation: KissBox Network CPU / Kissbox / B.Bouchez / (20/02/2014)

"access to HD firmware is restricted to MMA HDWG members until official publication of HD protocol
specification"

- based on 32 bits word
- a message is multiple 32 bits words
- no marker to identify the first word of a message
- messages for saving/restoring state of an HD network (dump settings from an "entity")
- real time messages vs beat-timestamped messages (with "bundles" at the same timestamp)
- variable length messages
- transports: USB, Ethernet
- plug & play of devices
- higher resolution controls
- more throughput
- MIDI Device compatibility
- traditional notes as well as direct pitch notes
- note update for per-note controls (control+pitch)
- has a transport protocol (USB + some protocol compatible with RTP-MIDI, while being independent)

Opinion:

"HD-MIDI promises to be improved and more versatile, and does so by
adding complexity in ways that not everybody will find
useful. HD-MIDI, at least, has industry consensus. If it is
sufficiently more effective than MIDI 1.0, it may yet form part of a
complete next-generation protocol." Ben Supper / Novation/Focusrite

* Device discovery

Emagic SoundDiver 3.0 was able to automatically detect some MIDI devices.
