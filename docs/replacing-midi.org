* MIDI has succeeded

After having been initially introduced in 1983, MIDI has been
developped by members of the MMA (Midi Manufacturer Association.)

- Cheap and thus everywhere
- With musical structure
- Simple to understand and implement
- Forward compatible and extensible: escaping (SYSEX) is possible, undefined statuses are ignored
- A good fit for modern protocols: serial, point-to-point
- New transports brings better throughput: RTP-MIDI (Midi over IP), USB

* MIDI has failed

- 14-bit resolution although available is poorly understood and
  implemented in software and hardware
- Conventions set by the standard (CC, NRPNs) have not been followed
  by software and hardware
- Users are required to understand the protocol at a quite low level
  when buying/integrating hardware
- control signals in practice not strictly aligned with audio

* MIDI has an official successor: HD

Still designed behind closed doors since 2005. Proof of its life
exist: it has been demonstrated on January 27 2013, and the KissBox V3
supports it.

- offers higher resolution controls (16-bit)
- direct pitch control for notes
- note updates adjust a note after onset
- messages are 32-bit and variable length, and can be timestamped
- claims compatibility with MIDI
- plug&play devices
- messages exists to save/restore the settings of devices

Does it solve problems user have with MIDI? Hard to know.
